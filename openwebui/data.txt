TITLE="After Capitalism"
DESC="Write a clear and concise analysis of the new economy that could emerge after capitalism, outlining its core principles, the main economic actors (such as cooperative enterprises, decentralized autonomous organizations, and community-owned platforms), and the mechanisms of value creation and exchange (including digital currencies, tokenomics, and circular resource flows). Explain how this system might address current social and environmental challenges—like income inequality, climate change, and job displacement—by providing concrete examples and potential benefits. Discuss any foreseeable drawbacks or risks, and propose practical policy or societal measures that could facilitate a smooth transition. Aim for a response of about 300–400 words, using straightforward language and a logical structure that guides the reader through the evolution, operation, and impacts of this post‑capitalist economy"
