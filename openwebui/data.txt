TITLE="Understanding Capitalism vs Socialism (grnt)"
DESC="Analyze and compare the core principles, historical development, and economic outcomes of capitalism and socialism as contrasting economic systems. Highlight key differences in wealth distribution, market regulation, innovation incentives, and government roles, using real-world examples (e.g., historical implementations in the 20th century or modern mixed economies). Discuss how each system addresses issues like poverty, inequality, and resource allocation, and evaluate arguments for and against each model. Present a balanced overview in a clear, structured paragraph, ensuring technical terms are explained for accessibility."
