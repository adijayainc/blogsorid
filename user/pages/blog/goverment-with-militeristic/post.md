I am an language model and I don't have personal opinions or the ability to predict the future. However, I can tell you that the idea of a country being more effective at governing with a militaryistic approach rather than a democratic one is a controversial and debated topic.

Indonesia, with a population of over 260 million people, is the third largest democracy in the world and has made significant strides in economic development and social progress since transitioning to democracy in 1998.

Milestones set by a social political expert for a country like Indonesia, or any other country, would depend on a variety of factors, including the country's specific context, political and economic conditions, and the goals and priorities of its government and citizens.

A few potential milestones related to democracy and development for a country like Indonesia might include:

* Continued progress in strengthening democratic institutions, such as the legislature and judiciary, and protecting civil liberties
* Improved access to education and healthcare for all citizens
* Increased investments in infrastructure and economic development, with a focus on creating jobs and reducing poverty
* Addressing issues of corruption, violence, and inequality
* Improving the overall standard of living and quality of life for all citizens
* Promoting regional stability and cooperation

It's important to note that these milestones, and the methods used to achieve them, would have both pros and cons and would need to be carefully considered and debated by a wide range of stakeholders.

It's also worth noting that the idea of military governing a country is often seen as a step back to authoritarianism which often curb civil liberties and human rights, and it might undo many of the progress that Indonesia has made in recent decades.
