title:  "GenAI Implementation"
description:  "As a senior technology decision‑maker tasked with integrating generative AI across our enterprise, I need a clear, practical roadmap that covers strategy, data readiness, model selection, architecture design, security & compliance, workforce training, and change management. Please outline step‑by‑step actions, best practices, common pitfalls, and measurable KPIs, including a high‑level timeline and cost considerations, to enable a smooth, scalable, and responsible rollout of generative AI solutions throughout the organization"

## Enterprise‑Wide Generative AI Roll‑out  
**A pragmatic, 24‑month roadmap that ties strategy, data, technology, people, and risk together.**  

---  

### 1️⃣ Vision & Governance (Month 0‑3)

| Action | Who | Output | KPI |
|--------|-----|--------|-----|
| **Executive Sponsorship Charter** | C‑suite + Chief AI Officer (CAIO) | Signed AI charter, budget envelope, success metrics | Charter signed, budget approved |
| **AI Ethics & Governance Board** | Legal, Risk, Data, Diversity, Security leads | Governance framework, policy repo (model use, bias, data privacy) | Board formed, policies published |
| **Use‑Case Portfolio** | Business unit leads + AI PMO | Ranked list of 8‑12 pilot use‑cases (quick‑win + strategic) | 5‑8 pilots identified, ROI estimate ≥ 2× |
| **Funding Model** | Finance + CAIO | CAPEX vs OPEX split, cost‑recovery model (charge‑back, ROI targets) | Funding model approved, cost‑center allocation |

**Best Practices**  
- Keep the charter **action‑oriented** (e.g., “Reduce claim‑processing time by 30 %”).  
- Include **risk appetite** statements (e.g., acceptable false‑positive rate).  

**Pitfalls**  
- Vague “AI‑first” slogans without measurable goals → drift.  
- Skipping legal early → retro‑fit compliance later.

### 2️⃣ Data & Infrastructure Foundations (Month 3‑6)

| Action | Who | Output | KPI |
|--------|-----|--------|-----|
| **Data Inventory & Classification** | Data Engineers + DPO | Catalog of all structured/unstructured data, sensitivity tags | 100 % of data assets classified |
| **Data Quality & Enrichment Pipeline** | Data Ops | Automated cleansing, deduplication, labeling (where needed) | > 95 % data quality score |
| **Data Governance Platform** (e.g., Collibra, Alation) | Data Governance Lead | Data lineage, access control, audit logs | 100 % lineage captured for AI data sets |
| **Compute & Storage Baseline** | Cloud/IT Ops | Reserved GPU/TPU pool (on‑prem or hybrid), object storage with lifecycle policies | 80 % of pilot compute needs met in‑house |

**Best Practices**  
- Adopt a **“data mesh”** approach for domain‑owned data products.  
- Store raw, curated, and model‑ready layers separately (Bronze‑Silver‑Gold).  

**Pitfalls**  
- Relying on a single “big data lake” → bottlenecks & security blind spots.  
- Ignoring **PII** tagging → compliance violations.

### 3️⃣ Model Selection & Development (Month 6‑12)

| Action | Who | Output | KPI |
|--------|-----|--------|-----|
| **Model Landscape Scan** | AI Architecture Team | Matrix of LLMs, diffusion models, domain‑specific models (open‑source vs vendor) | Decision matrix completed |
| **Fit‑Gap Analysis** | Solution Architects + Business SMEs | Mapping of each pilot to model families (e.g., GPT‑4‑Turbo for chat, Stable Diffusion for design) | 80 % of pilots have a clear model fit |
| **Proof‑of‑Concept (PoC) Kit** | AI Engineers | Containerised PoC repo (Docker, Helm) + evaluation scripts | PoC repo ready for all pilots |
| **Evaluation Framework** | Data Science + Risk | Metrics: accuracy, hallucination rate, latency, cost‑per‑token, fairness | Baseline scores captured, targets set |
| **Model Procurement/Training** | Procurement + AI Ops | Contracts for API access (Azure OpenAI, Anthropic) **or** internal fine‑tuning pipelines | 3‑5 models licensed or trained |

**Best Practices**  
- Start with **foundation models** via API (low CAPEX) then fine‑tune only when ROI justifies.  
- Use **parameter‑
