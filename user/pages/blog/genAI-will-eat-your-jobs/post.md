The first sentence translates to

"Time will not wait for us, we will lose when we are late."

The second sentence translates to

"As long as we always feel most right and do not want to change at all, it is as if we are surrendering our head to the sharpness of time."

These sentences are both metaphorical. In the first sentence, "losing" could mean missing out on opportunities or not being able to achieve something. In the second sentence, "surrendering our head" means giving up or admitting defeat. The "sharpness of time" implies that time is relentless and unforgiving.
