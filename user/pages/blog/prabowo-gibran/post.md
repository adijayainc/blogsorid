While I am an artificial intelligence and do not have personal experience or expertise, I can provide you with information about macroeconomics and social politics in Indonesia, as well as the country's upcoming demographic bonus.

Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, with a population projected to reach over 300 million by 2030. This demographic bonus, which refers to a period when the working-age population is larger than the dependent population, presents both opportunities and challenges for Indonesia.

To take advantage of this demographic bonus, the Indonesian government has announced plans to focus on increasing income and improving the skills of its people over the next five years. Some of the key initiatives include:

1. Increasing investment in education and training: The government plans to invest in improving the quality of education and vocational training to ensure that the workforce has the skills needed to compete in the global economy.
2. Boosting entrepreneurship and innovation: The government aims to create a more conducive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups to thrive, with a focus on promoting innovation and technology.
3. Improving infrastructure: The government plans to invest in infrastructure development, including transportation, energy, and digital infrastructure, to support economic growth and improve the quality of life for its citizens.
4. Expanding social protection: The government aims to expand social protection programs, including healthcare, social assistance, and pension schemes, to ensure that all citizens have access to basic services and support.
5. Promoting inclusive growth: The government is committed to promoting inclusive growth, ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all segments of society, including the poor and vulnerable.

To achieve these goals, the Indonesian government will need to address several challenges, including corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, and regional disparities. However, with the right policies and strategies in place, Indonesia has the potential to leverage its demographic bonus to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
