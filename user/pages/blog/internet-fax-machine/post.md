Paul Krugman, a renowned economist, once stated that the internet's economic impact had not surpassed the fax machine's during the late 1990s dot-com bubble. He made this claim based on several key reasons:


1. **Immediate Impact**: Fax machines provided immediate and tangible benefits to businesses by streamlining communication, reducing paperwork, and enabling faster transactions. In contrast, the internet's impact was more gradual, with its effects becoming apparent only as it became a ubiquitous part of daily life.


2. **Measurable Effects**: Fax machines had clear, measurable outcomes such as reduced fax machine costs and increased efficiency in business operations. The internet's economic impact was more difficult to quantify due to its diffuse nature and the lack of a single, centralized platform for all businesses to benefit from it.


3. **Overhyped Expectations**: During the 1990s, there were overhyped expectations about the internet's potential to revolutionize business and society. This led to a false sense of urgency and investment in early internet technologies that did not deliver on their promises.


4. **Network Externalities and Adoption Costs**: Krugman's economic theory of 'network externalities' suggests that the value of a technology increases as more people use it. However, the cost of adopting new technologies can be high due to infrastructure and other barriers. The internet's slower integration was partly due to these costs, which made it less accessible to many businesses initially.


5. **Streamlining Communication**: Fax machines directly streamlined communication by reducing the need for physical documents and allowing for faster transmission of information. In contrast, the internet's impact on business processes was more indirect, with businesses having to adapt their operations to work with new technologies.


In conclusion, Krugman's argument highlights the importance of understanding the immediate and measurable effects of technology on productivity and business processes. He also emphasizes the role of overhyped expectations in shaping our perception of technological progress.
