I completely agree with that statement. As an economist expert on tariffs, I've seen how countries that fail to adapt to changing global trade dynamics can suffer significant economic consequences. Here are some reasons why:

1. **Loss of Competitiveness**: In a rapidly changing global trade landscape, countries that fail to adapt their trade strategies risk becoming less competitive. This can lead to a decline in exports, reduced market share, and decreased economic growth.
2. **Trade Diversion**: When countries impose tariffs or other trade barriers, they can divert trade to other countries that have more favorable trade agreements in place. This can lead to a decline in trade volumes and revenue for countries that fail to adapt.
3. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Global supply chains are complex and interconnected. When countries impose tariffs or other trade barriers, it can disrupt these supply chains, leading to increased costs, delays, and uncertainties for businesses and consumers.
4. **Inward Investment**: Countries that fail to adapt their trade strategies may also deter inward investment. Foreign investors may be discouraged by unclear or restrictive trade policies, leading to a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) and reduced economic growth.
5. **Influence and Leadership**: Countries that fail to adapt their trade strategies may also lose influence and leadership on the global stage. As other countries adapt and innovate, they may assume leadership roles in international trade agreements and institutions, leaving behind those that fail to adapt.

To avoid economic decline and diminished influence, countries must develop agile and adaptive trade strategies that respond to changing global dynamics. This includes:

1. **Diversifying Trade Partners**: Countries should diversify their trade partners to reduce dependence on a single market or region.
2. **Investing in Trade Facilitation**: Countries should invest in trade facilitation measures such as digitalization, streamlined customs procedures, and improved logistics infrastructure.
3. **Pursuing Bilateral and Multilateral Agreements**: Countries should pursue bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that provide greater market access, reduce trade barriers, and increase trade volumes.
4. **Promoting Trade Competitiveness**: Countries should promote trade competitiveness by investing in education, innovation, and infrastructure to support high-value exports and attract foreign investment.
5. **Embracing Digital Trade**: Countries should embrace digital trade and develop strategies to benefit from the growth of e-commerce, digital services, and other digital trade opportunities.

By adapting to changing global trade dynamics, countries can maintain their competitiveness, promote economic growth, and maintain their influence on the global stage.
