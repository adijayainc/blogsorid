That's correct. The Hijrah, also known as the Hegira, was a pivotal event in Islamic history that marked the migration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his followers, known as the Sahabah, from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. This migration was a response to the persecution and hostility they faced in Mecca, and it marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

The Hijrah was a significant turning point in the life of Muhammad and the early Muslim community. In Mecca, Muhammad had faced opposition and violence from the pagan Arabs, who saw him as a threat to their traditional way of life. After his uncle Abu Talib, who had protected him, died, Muhammad's situation became even more precarious.

In 622 CE, Muhammad received an invitation from the people of Medina, who were mostly Jews and Arabs, to come and live among them. They offered him protection and a place to establish a Muslim community. Muhammad accepted the invitation and, along with his followers, made the journey to Medina.

The Hijrah marked the beginning of a new era for the Muslim community. In Medina, Muhammad was able to establish a Muslim state, with its own system of government, laws, and social structures. He also built the first mosque, known as the Masjid al-Nabawi, which became a center of Islamic learning and worship.

The Hijrah is considered a significant event in Islamic history because it marked the transition of the Muslim community from a small, persecuted minority to a thriving and self-governing community. It also marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar, which is based on the lunar cycle and begins with the month of Muharram, the month of the Hijrah.

Today, the Hijrah is still celebrated by Muslims around the world as a reminder of the importance of perseverance, faith, and community. It is a time for reflection, prayer, and celebration, and it is often marked with special events, lectures, and gatherings.
