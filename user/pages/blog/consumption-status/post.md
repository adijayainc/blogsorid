According to Thorstein Veblen, an American economist and sociologist, consumption and status are closely linked. In his seminal work, "The Theory of the Leisure Class" (1899), Veblen argues that consumption is not just about satisfying physical needs, but also about displaying social status.

**Conspicuous Consumption:**
Veblen introduced the concept of "conspicuous consumption," which refers to the practice of acquiring and displaying luxury goods and services to demonstrate one's wealth and social standing. This type of consumption is not driven by necessity or utility, but rather by the desire to showcase one's status and prestige.

**Status Symbolism:**
Veblen argues that certain goods and services become status symbols, which are used to signal an individual's position within the social hierarchy. These status symbols can include items like expensive clothing, jewelry, cars, and luxury vacations. The acquisition and display of these symbols serve as a means of communicating one's wealth and status to others.

**The Leisure Class:**
Veblen's concept of the "leisure class" refers to the social group that has the means to engage in conspicuous consumption. Members of the leisure class have the financial resources to pursue activities and acquire goods that are not essential to their survival, but rather serve to demonstrate their status. The leisure class is characterized by its ability to indulge in luxury and extravagance, which is seen as a mark of distinction and refinement.

**Key aspects of consumption and status according to Veblen:**

1. **Display of wealth**: Consumption is a means of displaying one's wealth and social standing.
2. **Status symbolism**: Certain goods and services become status symbols, which are used to signal an individual's position within the social hierarchy.
3. **Conspicuous consumption**: The acquisition and display of luxury goods and services is driven by the desire to showcase one's status and prestige.
4. **Emulation**: Members of lower social classes often emulate the consumption patterns of the leisure class, aspiring to achieve a similar status.
5. **Social comparison**: Consumption is driven by social comparison, where individuals compare their own status and possessions to those of others.

**Critique of modern society:**
Veblen's work is often seen as a critique of modern society, where the pursuit of status and wealth is prioritized over other values like community, equality, and social welfare. He argues that the emphasis on conspicuous consumption can lead to waste, extravagance, and social inequality.

Overall, Veblen's ideas on consumption and status highlight the complex and often superficial nature of social relationships in modern society, where the display of wealth and status can become an end in itself, rather than a means to achieve true fulfillment or happiness.
