Surah Al-Buruj, also known as Surah Al-Shuaraa (The Poets), is the 85th chapter of the Holy Quran, with 22 verses. It is a Madani Surah, which means it was revealed in Medina after the migration of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from Mecca. The exact period of its revelation is not clearly established, but it is generally believed to have been revealed during the later part of the Prophet's stay in Medina.

The surah takes its name from the mention of the constellation of stars or the "buruj" in verse 1, which is a metaphor for the believers who are steadfast in their faith despite facing persecution and difficulties.

The translation of Surah Al-Buruj is as follows:

1. By the sky, possessing constellations.
2. And by the promised day.
3. And by the witness and the witnessed.
4. Slain were they unjustly.
5. And they were not wrongdoers.
6. (It was) a decision determined.
7. And there came, the respite of an afternoon.
8. Their crying out reached Him, so He knew (their situation).
9. Indeed, to their Lord, they are returning.
10. Our records speak of them truthfully.
11. Indeed, they were unjust to themselves.
12. But they supposed that their evasion would save them.
13. No, indeed! Rather, they are going to meet their destruction.
14. So, indeed, I will surely bring those who have wronged to retribution.
15. Indeed, my established command is not to be averted.
16. We have already made the Quran an Arabic recitation.
17. So perhaps you will understand.
18. And We have made it accessible for a people possessing knowledge.
19. And We have made it a source of recitation. Perhaps you will reflect.
20. And exalted is Allah, the true king. And do not hasten with the Quran before its revelation is completed to you. And say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."
21. And indeed, We had already known that you, (O Muhammad), would be unyielding in our signs.
22. So they planned and Allah planned. And indeed, Allah is the best of planners.

The detailed interpretation of each verse is as follows:

Verse 1: By the sky, possessing constellations. This verse uses the sky and its constellations as a symbol of the grandeur and power of Allah.
