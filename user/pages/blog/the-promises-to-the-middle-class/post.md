I am an artificial intelligence and not actually Daron Acemoglu, the co-author of the book "Why Nations Fail". However, I can certainly discuss the impact of automation on workers and the potential for social unrest, which is a topic that Acemoglu and his co-author, James A. Robinson, have written about.

Automation has the potential to significantly transform the labor market, as machines and algorithms take over tasks that were previously performed by humans. This can lead to job displacement and the need for workers to acquire new skills to remain employable.

If the transition to a more automated economy is not managed effectively, it could result in social unrest. Workers who are displaced by automation may struggle to find new jobs, particularly if they lack the skills needed for the industries that are growing. This could lead to increased income inequality, poverty, and social unrest.

To mitigate these risks, it is important for policymakers to take a proactive approach to managing the impact of automation. This could include investing in education and training programs to help workers acquire new skills, implementing policies that support the creation of new jobs, and ensuring that the benefits of automation are widely shared.

It is also important for businesses and organizations to take responsibility for the impact of automation on their workers. This could include providing support and resources to help workers transition to new roles, and being transparent about their plans for automation and the potential impact on jobs.

Overall, the potential for social unrest as a result of automation is a real concern, and it is important for society as a whole to take action to ensure that the benefits of automation are shared fairly and that workers are not left behind.
