### 1. 1945 – 1949: Birth of the Republic and the Revolutionary Struggle  

| Date | Milestone / Event | Significance |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| **17 Aug 1945** | **Proclamation of Independence** by **Sukarno** (President) and **Mohammad Hatta** (Vice‑President) in Jakarta. | Ended Japanese occupation; declared a sovereign state based on Pancasila. |
| **18 Aug 1945** | Formation of the **Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI)** in Sumatra. | Demonstrated the resolve to govern despite the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. |
| **30 Oct 1945** – **16 Nov 1945** | **Battle of Surabaya** (Indonesian National Armed Forces vs. British/KNIL). | First major urban battle; became a symbol of “*Merdeka!*” (freedom). |
| **1946** | **Linggadjati Agreement** (Dec 15) – Dutch recognise de facto authority over Java, Sumatra, and West Borneo; both sides agree on a federal United States of Indonesia (RUSI). | First diplomatic concession by the Netherlands, though later violated. |
| **1947** | **First Dutch “Politionele Actie” (Operation Product)** – large‑scale Dutch economic and military offensive. | Forced Indonesian leadership to appeal to the United Nations. |
| **1948** | **Second Dutch “Politionele Actie” (Operation Kraai)** – capture of Yogyakarta (the republican capital) and arrest of Sukarno, Hatta, and other leaders. | International outcry; the Republic’s government continued in exile in Bukittinggi. |
| **1949 (Jan‑Oct)** | **UN‑mediated negotiations** at the **Round Table Conference** in The Hague. | Resulted in the **Transfer of Sovereignty** (27 Dec 1949) from the Netherlands to the Republic of Indonesia, ending the colonial war. |
| **27 Dec 1949** | **Transfer of sovereignty**; the **United States of Indonesia (RUSI)** formally established. | The Netherlands officially recognized Indonesian independence, though a federal structure soon gave way to a unitary state. |

**Key Figures** – Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Sutan Sjahrir (first Prime Minister), General **Sudirman** (army commander), **Tan Malaka**, **Sukarno’s** wife **Fatmawati** (designer of the Red‑White flag), and **Prince** **Mohammad Moehammad Jusuf** (diplomat).
