I'm assuming you're asking for examples of real-world problems that can be solved or significantly helped by general AI, which is a type of artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. While it's true that there is a lot of hype around AI, there are also many real-world applications where AI has made significant progress. Here are some examples:

1. Medical Diagnosis: AI can help doctors diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, and identifying patterns that might be missed by human eyes.
2. Natural Disaster Response: AI can help predict natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods, and can assist in responding to these disasters by analyzing data from various sources and providing insights for emergency response teams.
3. Cybersecurity: AI can help detect and respond to cyber attacks by analyzing network traffic and identifying unusual behavior patterns that might indicate a security breach.
4. Supply Chain Optimization: AI can help optimize supply chains by predicting demand, identifying bottlenecks, and suggesting ways to improve efficiency.
5. Fraud Detection: AI can help detect financial fraud by analyzing transactions and identifying patterns that might indicate fraudulent activity.
6. Language Translation: AI can help translate languages by analyzing text and identifying patterns in the language structure.
7. Personalized Education: AI can help personalize education by analyzing student behavior and identifying areas where they might need additional support.
8. Climate Change Modeling: AI can help model climate change by analyzing data from various sources and providing insights for climate scientists.
9. Autonomous Vehicles: AI can help enable autonomous vehicles by analyzing data from sensors and making decisions based on that data.

It's important to note that while AI has made significant progress in these areas, there is still a lot of work to be done. AI systems can make mistakes, and there are ethical considerations around the use of AI that need to be addressed. Nonetheless, AI has the potential to solve many real-world problems, and the field of AI research is continuing to make progress.
