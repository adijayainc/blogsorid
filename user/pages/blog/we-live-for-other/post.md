A beautiful quote from the Islamic tradition!

This is a well-known passage from the Quran (Al-Fatihah 1:5-7), which is part of the opening chapter (Fatihah) recited by Muslims in their daily prayers. The translation you provided is accurate:

"Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims."

In this passage, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is declaring his devotion to Allah (God), affirming that all aspects of his life - his worship, sacrifices, living, and even death - are for the sake of Allah. He is also emphasizing the Oneness of Allah, stating that He has no partner or equal.

The phrase "And of this I have been commanded" refers to the revelation he received from Allah through the angel Gabriel, which guided him in his prophetic mission. The phrase "and I am the first of the Muslims" is a declaration of his own commitment and a statement about the nature of Islam, which he founded.

This passage has great significance in Islamic theology, as it underscores the essential teachings of Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah) and Risalah (prophethood), highlighting the Prophet Muhammad's role as the messenger of Allah.
