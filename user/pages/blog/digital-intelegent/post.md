In a rapidly changing world, it is indeed important to be prepared for the future and to be adaptable. However, being an "expert of anything" may not be the most effective strategy. The world is changing so quickly that the skills and knowledge that are in demand today may be outdated tomorrow.

Instead, it may be more beneficial to focus on developing a broad set of skills and a growth mindset. This means being willing to learn and adapt, and to constantly seek out new information and experiences. Some specific steps you can take to prepare for the future include:

1. Keep up with industry trends and developments. This can help you anticipate changes and stay ahead of the curve.
2. Develop a strong foundation in core skills that are less likely to change, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.
3. Seek out opportunities to learn and gain new experiences, such as through training programs, workshops, and networking events.
4. Be open to new ideas and willing to consider different perspectives. This can help you adapt to change and find creative solutions to problems.
5. Cultivate a growth mindset, which means believing that you can improve and learn new things, and being persistent in the face of challenges.

By focusing on these kinds of skills and mindsets, you will be better prepared to navigate the rapid changes of the future.
