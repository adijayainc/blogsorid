"how we survive in deep rain forrest"
 In the deep rain forest, life can be challenging due to poor visibility, limited resources, and limited shelter. Here are some steps you can follow to survive in this environment:

1. Prepare for the Rain: Wear comfortable, waterproof clothing. This will help protect your skin from getting wet, while keeping your body heat inside your coat. You may also want to carry a poncho or raincoat for added protection. 

2. Carry a Whistle: If you hear an approaching storm, blowing out your whistle can signal your group that it's time to move to safety. This could be a great way to get your group together and start planning shelter.

3. Follow Trail Markers: In the rainforest, markings might help you find your way. Look for raised, flat stones or fallen branches, which can indicate the presence of trails. 

4. Build Shelter: If the rain is heavy, build a small shelter by rolling up an old blanket or making a makeshift pad using leaves and twigs. This will provide some warmth and protection from the elements.

5. Fill Your Tank: With limited access to water, it might be wise to refill your fuel tank before heading into the rainforest. Bring a small container and fill it with clean water while you're stopped in a clearing or lay down on the ground.

6. Stay Aware: Remember, being aware of your surroundings is key. Keep an eye out for signs of wildlife like deer, birds, or other animals that might be seeking shelter in the rainforest. Listen for any sounds coming from outside and use these clues to your advantage.

7. Stay with Your Group: If you find yourself surrounded by a group of people, it can be helpful to stay together to share resources and work together to keep warm or out of harm's way. Remember, though, that the more people there are, the more difficult it may be for a group to navigate in the rainforest.

Remember, these steps are just guidelines and should not replace the advice and experience of an experienced guide. If you need help in the deep rainforest, or if you're unsure about what to do in such conditions, it is always advisable to consult with a trained guide before embarking on any journey.
