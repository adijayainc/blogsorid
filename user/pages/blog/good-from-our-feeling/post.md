It sounds like you are describing the potential downside of social media, where it can sometimes serve as an echo chamber for people's views and beliefs, leading them to perceive that their opinions are more widely held or accepted than they actually are. This can potentially have the effect of making certain ideas or actions seem more necessary or important than they really are.

As a blog writer with a large following on social media, it is important to be aware of this dynamic and strive to present a balanced and nuanced perspective in your writing. This can help to counteract the echo chamber effect and promote more thoughtful and informed discussions among your followers.

One way to do this is to seek out and consider a variety of viewpoints and sources when researching and writing about a topic. This can help you to present a more complete and accurate picture of the issue at hand, rather than just reinforcing a single point of view.

It is also important to engage with your followers in a respectful and open-minded way, even if you disagree with their opinions. This can help to foster a sense of community and mutual respect, and can encourage more productive and meaningful conversations.

Overall, as a blog writer with a large following on social media, you have the opportunity to influence and shape the conversations that take place on these platforms. By being mindful of the echo chamber effect and striving to present a balanced and nuanced perspective, you can help to promote more thoughtful and informed discussions among your followers.
