As an expert on high-speed transportation, I'm happy to share with you the various types of fast trains that can reach speeds over 300 km/h (186 mph). Here are a few examples:

1. **Shanghai Maglev Train**: This Chinese train has a top speed of 431 km/h (268 mph), making it the fastest commercial train in the world. However, it's not a traditional rail system but rather a magnetic levitation train that uses electromagnetic propulsion to lift and propel the train.
2. **CR400AF/BF High-Speed Train**: This Chinese high-speed train has a top speed of 350 km/h (217 mph) and is currently being used on several routes in China, including the Shanghai-Beijing route.
3. **Frecciarossa 1000**: This Italian high-speed train has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph), making it one of the fastest commercial trains in Europe.
4. **TGV Duplex**: The French TGV Duplex has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph) and is used on several routes in France, including the Paris-Lyon route.
5. **Shinkansen N700**: This Japanese high-speed train has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph) and is used on several routes in Japan, including the Tokyo-Osaka route.

However, if you're looking for trains that can reach speeds over 300 km/h using traditional rail technology, here are some examples:

1. **ICE 3**: This German high-speed train has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph) and is used on several routes in Germany.
2. **Thalys evo**: The Thalys evo train has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph) and is used on several routes in Europe, including the Paris-Amsterdam route.
3. **AVE S-103**: This Spanish high-speed train has a top speed of 310 km/h (193 mph) and is used on several routes in Spain.

These are just a few examples, but there are many other fast trains around the world that can reach speeds over 300 km/h.
