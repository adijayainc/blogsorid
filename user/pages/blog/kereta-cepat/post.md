A fast train that runs over 300 km/h is known as a High-Speed Rail (HSR) or a maglev train. Some examples of such trains include:

1. **Shanghai Maglev Train**: This Chinese train operates at a speed of 431 km/h (268 mph), making it the fastest commercial train in the world.
2. **CR400AF/BF Series**: Developed by China's CRRC Corporation, this train series has reached speeds of up to 350 km/h (217 mph).
3. **L0 Series Maglev Train**: Japan's L0 Series Maglev Train has a top speed of 603 km/h (375 mph), making it the fastest operational maglev train.
4. **Chuo Shinkansen**: This proposed Japanese high-speed rail line is expected to reach speeds of up to 500 km/h (311 mph).
5. **Euspann Maglev Train**: The Euspann Maglev Train, currently under development in Spain, aims to reach speeds of up to 300 km/h (186 mph).

Other notable mentions include:

* **Frecciarossa 1000**: An Italian train that reached a speed of 320 km/h (200 mph) in 2019.
* **TGV Duplex**: A French train that has achieved speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph).
* **Shinkansen N700S**: A Japanese train that has reached speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph).

These high-speed trains have significantly reduced travel times, improved passenger experience, and transformed the way people travel across vast distances.
