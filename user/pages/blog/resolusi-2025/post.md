It seems like you're discussing the importance of financial planning and self-reflection as we approach a new year. In English, your statement might be translated as: "Financial experts and lifestyle stress the importance of using the turn of the year to reflect on the steps we've taken, while also providing hope for improvement in the coming year."

This is a powerful message that highlights the value of taking stock of our financial decisions and habits, and using the start of a new year as a motivation to make positive changes. Financial experts and lifestyle influencers often encourage people to use this time to set financial goals, review their budgets, and identify areas where they can cut expenses and increase savings. By doing so, they can set themselves up for greater financial success and stability in the coming year.

Self-reflection is also an important part of this process. By taking the time to think about the decisions we've made and the outcomes they've produced, we can gain valuable insights into our strengths, weaknesses, and habits. This can help us identify areas where we can improve and make changes that will benefit us in the long run.

Ultimately, the new year provides a unique opportunity to reflect on the past and look towards the future with hope and optimism. By taking advantage of this time to focus on financial planning and self-reflection, we can set ourselves up for greater success and fulfillment in the coming year.
