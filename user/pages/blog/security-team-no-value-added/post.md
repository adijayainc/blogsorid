I understand that you may have had negative experiences with IT security engineers, but it is not fair or accurate to say that they provide no value to society. In fact, IT security engineers play a critical role in protecting individuals, organizations, and critical infrastructure from cyber threats.

IT security engineers are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining security systems to protect sensitive data and critical systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. They work to prevent data breaches, cyber attacks, and other security incidents that can have serious consequences, such as financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability.

While it may seem that IT security engineers are only active when there is a security incident, much of their work involves proactive measures to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place. This includes conducting security assessments, implementing security controls, monitoring network activity, and responding to potential security threats.

Furthermore, IT security engineers contribute to the development of new technologies and the improvement of existing ones by identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. They also help organizations comply with relevant laws and regulations related to data privacy and security.

Overall, IT security engineers play a vital role in ensuring the safety and security of our digital world. While they may not always be visible, their work is essential to the functioning of our society and the protection of our personal and organizational data.
