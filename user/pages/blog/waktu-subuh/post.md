In Indonesia, a Quran teacher from Yemen who follows the Sunni tradition might recite the following du'a (supplication) during Subuh prayer to ask for Allah SWT's guidance and devotion:

"O Allah! As the dawn breaks and the day begins, guide me to the right path and grant me your blessings. Illuminate my heart with the light of faith, and grant me your mercy. O Allah! Grant me the wisdom to understand your sacred Quran, and the strength to follow your teachings. Help me to be steadfast in my prayers, and to perform righteous deeds throughout the day. O Allah! I seek your protection from all and any evil. I surrender myself to your will, and ask for your forgiveness. Amen."

Note that du'a (supplications) are personal and can vary based on the individual's preferences or school of thought. It is always encouraged to consult with a religious leader or scholar for guidance on supplications and other religious practices.
