"A Daughter So Sweet and True"

A tiny hand, once held mine,
Now guides me through life's rhyme.
You grew up, full of spark and light,
And shone so bright, like a guiding sight.

With every step, you take your stand,
And make our hearts swell with pride in hand.
Your laughter echoes, contagious and free,
A joy to behold, for you and me.

As I watch you bloom, like a flower so fair,
I'm reminded of the love we share.
You're strong, kind, and gentle as can be,
A treasure to us, a gift from destiny.

So here's to you, my dear daughter mine,
May your dreams come true, one by one, in time.
Keep shining bright, like a beacon so bold,
And know that I'll always be here to hold.

I'm the proudest dad, with a heart full of cheer,
To have you as my daughter, and to be near.
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me,
A blessing from above, a gift to see.

Love you more than words can express,
Daddy"

Hope you like it!
