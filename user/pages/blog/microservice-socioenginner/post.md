As a veteran software engineer, I strongly agree that developing applications using microservices can be more effective than monolithic architectures in many scenarios. Here are some reasons why:

1. Scalability: Microservices allow for more fine-grained scalability since each service can be scaled independently based on its own demand. This can lead to more efficient resource utilization and cost savings.

2. Technology diversity: Microservices enable the use of different technologies for different services. This can result in using the best tool for the job and avoiding being locked into a single technology stack.

3. Fault isolation: If a problem occurs in one microservice, it's less likely to affect the entire application since each service runs independently. This can lead to increased system reliability and resilience.

4. Faster development and deployment: Microservices enable smaller, focused teams to work on individual services independently. This can lead to faster development cycles and quicker deployment of new features or bug fixes.

5. Improved maintainability: Since microservices are smaller and more focused, they are easier to maintain and understand. This can lead to improved code quality and a more sustainable development process.

However, microservices are not without their own challenges, such as increased complexity in managing and coordinating multiple services, distributed transaction management, and network latency. Careful consideration and planning are required to determine whether microservices or a monolithic architecture is the best fit for a particular project.
