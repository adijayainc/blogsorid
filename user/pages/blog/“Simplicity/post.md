It seems like we have two different quotes here!

Let me address each one:

1. "An street actor how work on tiny production house"

I think there might be a small issue with the grammar and spelling in this quote. It's hard to decipher what you're trying to convey, but if I had to take a guess, it seems like you might be referring to an actor who works for a small or independent production company? If that's correct, please let me know and I'd be happy to help with any questions or discussions!

2. "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

Ahah, now this one is a great quote! It's a beautiful way of expressing the idea that sometimes, simplicity can be incredibly elegant and refined. It's easy to get caught up in complexity and overthinking things, but sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective and impressive.

Do you have any thoughts or reflections on these quotes?
