"A person who is very proud to become an Indonesian"

I'm happy to hear that you take pride in being Indonesian! In order to provide you with a detailed and comprehensive answer about the history of Pancasila, I will first explain what Pancasila is, who created it, and the benefits it has brought to the Indonesian nation.

Pancasila is the official, foundational philosophy of the Indonesian state. The term "Pancasila" is derived from two Sanskrit words, "panca" meaning five, and "sila" meaning principles. Therefore, Pancasila consists of five principles that serve as the ideological foundation of the Indonesian state.

Pancasila was created by Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, and was proclaimed on June 1, 1945, during a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI). The five principles of Pancasila are:

1. Belief in the one and only God
2. Just and civilized humanity
3. The unity of Indonesia
4. Democracy guided by the inner wisdom in the unanimity arising out of deliberations amongst representatives
5. Social justice for all the people of Indonesia

Pancasila was created in response to the diversity of religious and ethnic groups in Indonesia, with the aim of unifying the nation and providing a set of principles that could be accepted by all Indonesians, regardless of their background.

The benefits of Pancasila for the Indonesian nation have been significant. Pancasila has provided a foundation for the development of a national identity that transcends religious and ethnic differences. It has also served as a basis for the development of a democratic system of government that respects the rights and freedoms of all citizens.

Pancasila has also played a role in promoting social justice and equality in Indonesia. The principle of social justice for all the people of Indonesia has been used to advocate for the rights of marginalized groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, and the poor.

In conclusion, Pancasila is the official, foundational philosophy of the Indonesian state, consisting of five principles that promote belief in one God, just and civilized humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by inner wisdom, and social justice for all. It was created by Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, in response to the diversity of religious and ethnic groups in Indonesia, with the aim of unifying the nation and providing a set of principles that could be accepted by all Indonesians. Pancasila has provided significant benefits for the Indonesian nation, including the development of a national identity, a democratic system of government, and the promotion of social justice and equality.
