As a writer of fiction, it can be useful to keep in mind that people tend to be more suspicious of someone who seems falsely certain. This is because authenticity and vulnerability are often seen as more trustworthy and relatable traits in a character. When a character exhibits a false sense of certainty, it can come across as insincere or even manipulative, causing readers to question their motives and reliability.

Instead, consider creating characters who are confident in their abilities and beliefs, but also acknowledge their uncertainties and limitations. This can make them more endearing and believable to readers. By allowing your characters to express doubt or question themselves, you can add depth and nuance to their personalities, making them more engaging and memorable.

Furthermore, creating characters with a balance of confidence and vulnerability can also add tension and conflict to your story. It can be tempting to create confident, infallible characters who always have the right answers, but this can make your story predictable and un engaging. By adding a layer of uncertainty or self-doubt, you can create opportunities for growth and development, as well as moments of triumph and redemption.

In summary, as a writer of fiction, remember that people are often more suspicious of false certainty in a character. By creating characters who are confident, but also vulnerable and authentic, you can make them more relatable, engaging, and believable to your readers.
