"fiscal year will be end by december , but october is very important for calculating company performance"
 In the context of fiscal years and calculating company performance, October can indeed be considered as very important. It's not just about a month or year but also the season which can significantly impact financial results. Companies tend to invest more in certain areas during this time.

The term "fiscal year" refers to how a country organizes its financial reporting and taxation. In Indonesia, fiscal years are usually from July 1st until June 30th. This is why October is important for calculating company performance. Companies typically report their performance in the second half of the fiscal year, so it's crucial to assess their performance over the last three months.

Fiscal years and performance reports are a key part of the Indonesian financial system. Companies often report on various aspects like revenue, expenses, and profits. The performance report is usually an overview or comparison of the company's financial performance for the past year compared to the previous year or three-month period.

Fiscal years in Indonesia also give companies a benchmark with which to compare against. For example, if a company performs well in its first fiscal year, it can look back and compare itself to the same time last year. This helps to gauge how successful a company has been and where it may need improvement.

The October month is significant because it falls during the holiday season, which can impact sales and business operations. Companies might be encouraged to invest in marketing campaigns or have special promotions that they'll be doing during this period. This makes it important for companies to monitor their performance during this time to assess if their strategies are working effectively.

In conclusion, the October month is significant because it falls during the holiday season and can impact sales, business operations, and company performance. It's crucial to take note of how your company is doing in comparison to previous months or fiscal years.
