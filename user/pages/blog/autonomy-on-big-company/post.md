I respectfully disagree with the premise that micro-management is the most effective approach for creating a big company such as Apple or Nvidia. In fact, research and real-world examples suggest that a more empowering and delegative leadership style is often more effective in the long run.

While micro-management can ensure short-term compliance and attention to detail, it can also hinder creativity, innovation, and employee engagement. When employees are constantly monitored and controlled, they may feel less motivated and less likely to take initiative or think outside the box. This can ultimately stifle the growth and success of the company.

On the other hand, a more empowering leadership style can foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and collaboration. When employees feel trusted and valued, they are more likely to take ownership of their work, seek out new opportunities, and develop creative solutions to problems. This can lead to a more dynamic, adaptable, and successful organization.

Apple and Nvidia, for example, are known for their innovative and dynamic cultures. While both companies have clear strategic visions and high standards for performance, they also empower their employees to take risks, experiment, and collaborate. This has helped them to stay at the forefront of their respective industries and achieve long-term success.

In conclusion, while micro-management may have its place in certain situations, it is not the most effective approach for creating a big and successful company like Apple or Nvidia. A more empowering and delegative leadership style that fosters creativity, innovation, and employee engagement is often more conducive to long-term success.
