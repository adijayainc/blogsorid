### 1. Strategic Vision & Alignment  

| Step | Action | Owner | Timeline | KPI |
|------|--------|-------|----------|-----|
| **1.1** | Define a clear AI vision that ties to the 3‑year business strategy (growth, cost, customer experience). | CEO + Strategy Team | Month 0 | AI Vision approved |
| **1.2** | Identify *AI‑Maturity Zones* – high‑impact, low‑effort, high‑risk, high‑cost. | COO & Data Lead | Month 0‑1 | Prioritized AI Roadmap |
| **1.3** | Create an “AI Center of Excellence” (CoE) charter (governance, funding, reporting). | CFO | Month 0‑1 | CoE charter signed |
| **1.4** | Secure Board‑level sponsorship and budget for a pilot portfolio. | CPO | Month 1 | Budget allocation |
| **1.5** | Communicate the AI vision through an internal town‑hall & intranet campaign. | CMO | Month 1 | Engagement metrics |

> **Quick win** – Launch a “AI in a Day” hackathon to surface ideas and showcase feasibility.  
> **Scalability** – Use the CoE to replicate successful pilots across units.

### 2. Robust Data Infrastructure  

| Step | Action | Owner | Timeline | KPI |
|------|--------|-------|----------|-----|
| **2.1** | Conduct a data inventory audit (sources, quality, ownership). | Data Engineering Lead | Month 0‑2 | Audit report |
| **2.2** | Implement a unified data lake / warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift). | IT Ops | Month 2‑4 | 95 % data ingest |
| **2.3** | Deploy data catalog & lineage tool (e.g., Collibra). | Data Governance | Month 3‑5 | Catalog coverage |
| **2.4** | Build automated data pipelines with monitoring & alerting (e.g., Airflow, dbt). | ETL Team | Month 4‑6 | Pipeline uptime 99.9% |
| **2.5** | Enforce data quality rules (missingness, outliers). | QA Lead | Month 5‑6 | Data quality score > 90% |

> **Case Study** – *Target* moved from siloed data warehouses to a single Snowflake lake, cutting data prep time from 6 weeks to 2 days.  
> **Scalability** – Adopt schema‑on‑read and incremental loading; use micro‑services for data access.
